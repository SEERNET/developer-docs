Welcome to the DeepAffects API! The DeepAffects API exposes many of the audio, text & video recognition & analytics capabilities, to empower you to develop speech-enabled applications. The Developer portal provides a variety of resources for working with the DeepAffects REST API, and example components you can use to jump-start your integration.

The DeepAffects APIs are organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) with Sync and Async options. All requests should be made over SSL. All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON.

The Realtime API is organized around [GRPC](http://grpc.io). All requests should be made using deepaffects client libraries.
