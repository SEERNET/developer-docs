The DeepAffects APIs are organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) with Sync and Async options. All requests should be made over SSL. All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON.

The Realtime API is organized around [GRPC](http://grpc.io). All requests should be made using deepaffects client libraries.
