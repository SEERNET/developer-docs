Welcome to the DeepAffects API! You can use this API to access all our API endpoints, such as the Audio Emotion API to analyze the emotion content of the audio clip, or the Denoising API to remove background noise from your audio clip.

The Sync and Async API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). All requests should be made over SSL. All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON.

The Realtime API is organized around [GRPC](http://grpc.io). All requests should be made using deepaffects client libraries.
