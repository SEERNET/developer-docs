DeepAffects uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new DeepAffects API key at our [developer portal](https://developers.deepaffects.com).
DeepAffects expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server along with the base url

deepaffects.configuration.api_key['apikey'] = '<API_KEY>'
